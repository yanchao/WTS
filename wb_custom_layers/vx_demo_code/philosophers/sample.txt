The Philosophers Demonstration Program
--------------------------------------

This program demonstrates Dijkstra's Dining Philosophers Problem
(see "Cooperating Sequential Processes," Technical Report EWD-123, Technological
University, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, (1965)).  It is considered a classic 
process synchronization problem.  It is implemented using SVR2 semaphores and 
curses.  With this as an example, you may be able to figure out how to use 
SV semaphores.
