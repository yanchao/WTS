The C demo Demonstration Program
----------------------------------

The C demo program demonstrates various C language features including
structures, character arrays, linked lists, and recursion.  You can
build and download this program to your VxWorks target.


Features
--------

The following features are demonstrated from main():

*   *Factorials:* The factorialDemo() function generates a factorial
    table from 0! to 9!. Set a watch on fact_table to see the
    creation of the table. This function calls the recursive function
    factorial().

*   *Fibonacci Sequence:* The fibonacciDemo() function creates a
    fibonacci sequence with ten terms. Set a watch on fib_table to
    see the creation of the sequence. This function calls the
    recursive function fibonacci().

*   *Structures, Arrays, and Linked Lists:* The remainder of the
    program is a loop that demonstrates pointers, arrays,
    structures, and linked lists. Set watches on cell_1, cell_2,
    cell_3, and cell_4 to see the linked list operations. Set a watch
    on the test_engineer[] array to see an array of structures.
